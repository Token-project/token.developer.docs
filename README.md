# Getting started

## Get started with the Token platform

The ultimate goal of 'TOKEN' is to develop an experimental ecosystem to enable the adoption of Distributed Ledger Technologies and to prove its value, via highly replicable Use Cases, as a driver for the transformation of public services towards an open and collaborative government model approach.

Token's Developer Platform offer a developer friendly set of plug-and-play services and open-source components for building decentralized apps and services.

This section can help you get acquainted with the current platform organization, explains how to get access to the different tools and endpoints, and provides additional resources that can help you build with the Token Services and APIs.

### How the platform is organized

The Token developer platform is organized into four different categories, based on use case and services/products.

We have put together a different page for each product to help you get started, which you can access below:

| Category | Service/Product |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Blockchain-based Notarization** | Stamping | [Get started](notarization/fundamentals.md) |
|  | On-Chain anchoring | [Get started](notarization/fundamentals.md) |
|  | Sign | Get started |
|  | Canis Major Blockchain Adaptor \(FIWARE\) | Get started |
|  | LedgerSync \(FIWARE\) | Get started |
| **Distributed and Decentralized Storage** | Token Storage Network | Get started |
|  | IPFS Web Gateway | [Get started](storage/ipfs-web-gateway.md) |
|  | IPFS Storage & Pinning Service | [Get started](storage/ipfs-storage-and-pinning-service/) |
| **Decentralized and Self-Sovereign Identity** | Token Connect | Get started |
|  | CERTH SSI | [Get started](ssi/fundamentals.md) |
| **Events and Message Streaming** | Token Streams | Get started |

### Documentation organization

Our technical documentation has separate sections to help you work with each of these different services. In each section, you will find the API references, and other resources to help you get started.

All the services APIs share similar fundamentals, and even include some common endpoint functionality. These shared concepts are discussed in the platform fundamentals section, including the following:

* [Developer portal](fundamentals-1/developer-portal.md), [organizations](fundamentals-1/organizations.md), and [apps](fundamentals-1/fundamentals.md)
* [Authentication](fundamentals-1/auth.md)
* [Rate limits](fundamentals-1/rate-limits.md)
