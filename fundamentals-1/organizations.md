# Organizations

Organizations profiles allow you to organize your work based on how you intend to use the Token APIs, so you can effectively manage your access to the APIs. Each Organization should contains at least one [App](fundamentals.md), with which you can generate the credentials required to use the Token APIs.  
 

### Configuring Organizations

#### Creating an Organization

To create an Organization, click on “Create an Organization” in your [Organizations page](https://developers.token-project.eu/organizations). You will be prompted to enter your Organization details.

#### Creating an App for your Organization

To create an App for your Organization, click on “New app” in your [Applications page](https://developers.token-project.eu/organizations). The App is where you can generate an APP ID and API secret key to start using the Token APIs.
