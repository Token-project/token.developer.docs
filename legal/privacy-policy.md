## **Personal data vs. cookies mechanism**

Information obtained through the cookies mechanism and operational data may constitute personal data within the meaning of GDPR in certain exceptional situations (for example IP address).

Such personal data are processed only to the extent that is necessary for the correct display of the page and provision of the Services.

Basis for processing of data collected through "Essential" cookies and operational data is the so-called legitimate interest of the Service administrator (Article. 6.1. (f) of GDPR). To this end, the following may occur:

* occasional analysis of log files to determine: which browsers are used by site visitors, which bookmarks, pages or subpages are most or least frequently visited or viewed, whether the page structure has no errors;
* prevention of unauthorised access to the website and distribution of malicious codes, interruption of denial of service attacks, as well as prevention of damage to computer systems and electronic communication systems.

You have the right to object to such processing.

However, if you agree to the use of "optional" cookies (e.g. provided by Google Analytics), the basis for data processing is your consent (Article 6.1. (a) of GDPR). You can withdraw your consent and delete cookies at any time (by clicking on the appropriate opt-out links provided in the cookie table above.). Withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

Obtained data will be deleted or anonymised no later than the expiry of the limitation period for potential claims related to the use of the website or sooner if you object effectively or withdraw consent.
