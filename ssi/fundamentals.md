# Introduction

## What is SSI

**Self-sovereign identity \(SSI\)** gives individuals or organizations the ability to control their identity information. SSI acknowledges that identity is about much more than logging in. 

Identity can be expanded to other uses by using verifiable attestations, called credentials, to prove things about yourself such as that you are a university diploma owner or that you are eligible to participate to an e-voting process. 

SSI uses verifiable, trustworthy credentials for the aforementioned use cases, meaning that the requestor of such credentials can cryptographically verify the claimed attestations. Identity owners autonomously use those credentials wherever they want and consent is requested whenever their information is to be accessed. 

Privacy is a critical feature of SSI because, without privacy, there is no control nor security. In SSI, the identity owner stays in control of who sees what. This represents a monumental shift in how identity functions on the internet and combined with blockchain technology an ecosystem of data sovereignty is now possible.

## CERTH SSI

TOKENâ€™s CERTH SSI is a set of services that allow implementing Self-Sovereign Identity ecosystems in order to establish digital trust. Thus, CERTH SSI allows entities to obtain and control a digital identity in order to be able to communicate and share certified data
between each other in a trustworthy, standardized and privacy-preserving way. Using these services, the entities are able to: 

- Obtain secure wallets for controlling and managing their Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs)
- Create and use private communication channels based on Decentralized Identifiers for information exchange
- Issue, prove, verify and revoke Verifiable Credentials

Subsequently, CERTH SSI provides entities with the ability to control identity-related data and consent on what personal information will be disclosed, shared and with whom. In this direction, any person, organization, agency, municipality or governmental service in general can take advantage of the unique characteristics of SSI. CERTH SSI is based on W3C Standards for Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials.
