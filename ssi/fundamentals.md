# Introduction

## What is SSI

**Self-sovereign identity \(SSI\)** gives individuals or organizations the ability to control their identity information. SSI acknowledges that identity is about much more than logging in. 

Identity can be expanded to other uses by using verifiable attestations, called credentials, to prove things about yourself such as that you are a university diploma owner or that you are eligible to participate to an e-voting process. 

SSI uses verifiable, trustworthy credentials for the aforementioned use cases, meaning that the requestor of such credentials can cryptographically verify the claimed attestations. Identity owners autonomously use those credentials wherever they want and consent is requested whenever their information is to be accessed. 

Privacy is a critical feature of SSI because, without privacy, there is no control nor security. In SSI, the identity owner stays in control of who sees what. This represents a monumental shift in how identity functions on the internet and combined with blockchain technology an ecosystem of data sovereignty is now possible.

## CERTH SSI

Token's CERTH SSI implementation is a platform in which a user can register, get a DID and request credentials. The user can have their credentials stored in their wallet and access them quickly and easily, without downloading any special software. Thus, CERTHâ€™s SSI is functioning as a service \(SSIaS\). 

This solution removes the burden of e-government bodies to maintain their own servers, storage or even custom software as all these functionalities are provided out of the box. 

In this direction, any organization, agency, municipality and governmental service in general can take advantage of the unique characteristics of SSI at no cost and at no time! Following you can find more details how is this achieved and you if you are a public sector service you can apply [https://ssi.token.iti.gr/apply](https://ssi.token.iti.gr/apply) to help you integrate the SSI to any service you require registration/login/verification for user identities.
